	## Game Deatails ##
		Rogue is a single player Roguelike Dungeon Crawler game.
		You have a 2D grid that the player and all objects sit upon, called a tile_map. 
		On this grid you have things like walls, monsters, traps, items, and the player.
		The goal of the game is to get as deep in the dungeon as possible.
