## Rogue ##
Rogue was a video game released in 1980, marked by randomly generated levels and near-infinite progression. It spawned
an entire genre of similar games known as Roguelikes, and BRogue is our take on that idea.
Here is a link to Wikipedia which has more details on the original rogue.

## Game Details ##
BRogue is a single player Roguelike Dungeon Crawler game. It operates on a turn-based combat system with a dynamic item system and several fleshed out enemy types.
BRogue is not a 1-1 recreation of the original Rogue, it is more like a loose homage to a classic. It has instead gained its own unique flair from our group as development has continued.
The goal of the game is to get as deep in the dungeon as possible. The dungeon is populated by many dangerous monsters, and deceptive magic. Gather as much gold as you can while you try to stay alive!

## Cool Cams ##
### Eric ###
Eric Holtz is working on the items functionality for Brogue. He has added scripting for all the item interactions, as well as functionality and effects resulting from the usage of the items. Items currently include melee weapons, armor, potions, and other miscellaneous items.

### Gabe ###
Each of you add here!  
Map Gen, levels...  

### Alex ###
Alex Tattersall is working on the core GameMaster turn order logic for Brogue, baseline Player logic, as well as UI/UX design. He has created the main combat loop for the game, created a sound manager system for global SFX and music, and created the second version of our UI and menu system.

A couple different animations for each enemy Type.  
~~A manual Astar Pathing algorithm.~~  
More to come...
