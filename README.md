## Game Deatails ##
Rogue is a single player Roguelike Dungeon Crawler game.  
You have a 2D grid that the player and all objects sit upon, called a tile_map.  
On this grid you have things like walls, monsters, traps, items, and the player.  
The goal of the game is to get as deep in the dungeon as possible.  

## Installation ##
Yeah... so... Learn Git... And Godot...  
At this time you have to download Godot first.  
Then download the git zip for the project into the godot file structure.  
Then open it in godot and execute it.  

## How To Play ##
Use W or H or Up-Arrow to move up  
Use A or J or Left-Arrow to move left  
Use S or K or Down-Arrow to move down  
Use D or L or Right-Arrow to move right  
Use SPACE to stand still for a turn  
Moving directly into enemies attacks them  
Use TAB or ESC to open the inventory/pause menu
