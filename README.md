## Rogue ##
Rogue was a video game released in 1980, marked by randomly generated levels and near-infinite progression. It spawned
an entire genre of similar games known as Roguelikes, and BRogue is our take on that idea.
Here is a link to Wikipedia which has more details on the original rogue.

## Game Details ##
Rogue is a single player Roguelike Dungeon Crawler game.  
You have a 2D grid that the player and all objects sit upon, called a tile_map.  
On this grid you have things like walls, monsters, traps, items, and the player.  
The goal of the game is to get as deep in the dungeon as possible.

Each of you add here!  
Map Gen, levels...
